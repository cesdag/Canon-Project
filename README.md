### *A canon on*
# Free Trade in Developing Countries

A project by Cesare Dagostino, Georgios Ellinas, Miguel van de Goor, Joep Hermus, Hemal Kanji, Joost Melchers and Binh Nguyen. As part of the MSc Economics' course Applied Economic Analysis 1, the canon is a summarized in-depth analysis on a subfield concerning our track Sustainability and Growth. 

- [x] The [abstract](https://github.com/BinhNguyen71/Canon-Project/blob/master/Abstract.md "Canon Abstract on Free Trade in Developing countries") will give a quick description
- [ ] [Research](https://github.com/BinhNguyen71/Canon-Project/blob/master/canonprep%20and%20sources.md "Work in Progress") is still in progress

We aim to be able to explain the key concepts about the liberalization of trade clearly and hope that any person will be able to understand the mechanisms concerning free trade hereforth.

Thank you
