That the benefits of opening up to trade are subject to discussion, is becoming 
increasingly clear with controversy arising around free trade agreements such as 
TTIP, CETA and TPP in the US. While elementary economic theory is quite clear in 
stating that free trade is good for everyone, if only to increase economic efficiency. 
But as with any theory, the question should be asked whether this can actually be 
observed in practice. Perhaps more sophisticated theories might better capture the 
mechanisms at work when countries open up to international trade. 

Because extensive trade liberalizations have been occurring in developing countries 
far more often in the recent past than in already developed countries, the examples 
and studies represented in this canon will mostly concern these developing
countries. It may also be argued that developing countries will face the worst of the 
disadvantages of free trade, as these are likely to face competition by the developed 
countries’ more competitive industries. 

(Insert stylized facts/short history here) 

This canon will provide you with references to models of international economics, 
both elementary and some more advanced ones, and study some identifiable cases 
of countries opening up to trade. By doing so, it should enable you to form an 
informed opinion on the topic of international trade and its implications. (It will also 
discuss a couple of questions that you might have in more detail. "Insert research 
questions here")
